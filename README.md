# MyFirstAlgorithms

This repository was made to keep the very first codes I've made during the first year of my computer science course in 2013.
It is mostly using PASCAL and the portuguese pseudo-language 'Portugol' used for learning purposes back on that time. (Never heard of Python, right?)

## How may I use those codes?

You might have a number of reasons to use this repository, such as:
* Curiosity
* Assess how bad I was (I guess?)
* Enjoy Yourself
* Start a talk with me

## Why do I keep this repository?

Basically because I believe we have to be proud of our history - No matter if you've made something you're shame of. Legacy code is legacy, after all, right?
How many people would like to have the opportunity to recover their first code as well?
